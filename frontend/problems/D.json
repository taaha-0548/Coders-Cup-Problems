  "statement": "Munnazzar cries a lot about his GPA. He stops crying if his GPA is at least <em>m</em>; otherwise, he continues crying. Every semester, his GPA increases by 1. If his current GPA is <em>n</em>, determine after how many semesters he will stop crying.",
  "input": "The first line contains an integer <em>T</em> — the number of test cases (<code>1 ≤ T ≤ 1000</code>). Each of the next <em>T</em> lines contains two space-separated integers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> (<code>0 ≤ n, m ≤ 600</code>), representing the current GPA and the minimum GPA Munnazzar wishes to have.",
  "output": "For each test case, print a single integer — the number of semesters after which Munnazzar will stop crying.",
