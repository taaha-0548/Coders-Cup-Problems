  "statement": "You are given two binary strings <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, each of length <em>N</em>. Your task is to make your <em>score</em> odd which is initially 0 by choosing <em>N</em> elements such that:<br><br>For each index <em>i</em> (1 ≤ <em>i</em> ≤ <em>N</em>), you will select either <code>A<sub>i</sub></code> or <code>B<sub>i</sub></code>. If the character you select is equal to \"1\", add 1 to the <em>score</em>. If the character is \"0\", add nothing. Your goal is to determine whether it is possible to make the <em>score</em> an odd number.",
  "input": "The first line contains an integer <em>T</em> — the number of test cases (<code>1 ≤ T ≤ 3·10<sup>5</sup></code>).<br><br>Then follow the test cases. Each test case has the following format:<br>- The first line contains an integer <em>N</em> — the length of the strings <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> (<code>1 ≤ N ≤ 20</code>).<br>- The second line contains <em>N</em> characters representing the binary string <em>A</em>.<br>- The third line contains <em>N</em> characters representing the binary string <em>B</em>.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the sum of <em>N</em> over all test cases does not exceed <code>3·10<sup>5</sup></code>. For all <em>i</em>, <code>A<sub>i</sub></code>, <code>B<sub>i</sub></code> ∈ {0,1}.",
  "output": "For each test case, print on a separate line <code>YES</code> if it is possible to make the <em>score</em> odd by selecting one character from each index as described, otherwise print <code>NO</code>. The output is case-insensitive.",
