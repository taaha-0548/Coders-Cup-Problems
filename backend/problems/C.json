  "statement": "Barry Allen needs to calculate the optimal route through the multiverse. Given a graph with N nodes and M edges, find the shortest path from node 1 to node N. However, Barry can use his speed force to teleport once, instantly moving to any node he hasn't visited yet.",
  "input": "The first line contains two integers N and M (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 5000). The next M lines each contain three integers u, v, and w, representing an edge from node u to node v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N, 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000).",
  "output": "Print the minimum distance from node 1 to node N, considering the speed force teleportation ability.",
