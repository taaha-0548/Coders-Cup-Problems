  "statement": "After the recent rain, almost all of Karachi was flooded. Thankfully, some land was still left dry. Due to the internet being cut off, Vali could not load Codeforces, so he decided to make a problem of his own (totally original!).\n\nHe represented the city as a 2D grid with <em>N</em> rows and <em>M</em> columns, where each cell is either flooded ('W') or dry ('.'). Vali wants to count how many <strong>ponds</strong> have formed in the city. A pond is defined as a connected set of water cells where two cells are considered connected if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nHelp Vali count all the ponds so he can report back to the residents how many isolated water pools are left in the city.",
  "input": "The first line contains two space-separated integers <em>N</em> and <em>M</em> (<code>1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100</code>). Each of the next <em>N</em> lines contains <em>M</em> characters, each either 'W' or '.' representing one row of the city grid.",
  "output": "Print a single integer — the number of ponds in the city.",
