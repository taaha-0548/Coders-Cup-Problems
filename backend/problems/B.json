  "statement": "When cooking, using a mix of spices enhances the flavor more than using only one type of spice. Mixed spice is a seasoning made by mixing several spices in a predetermined ratio.<br><br>You are trying to make as large a quantity of mixed spices as possible by purchasing a couple of different spices as your budget allows. You already have some of the spices on hand. In addition, you can buy as many spices as you want, as long as the total cost of the spices purchased does not exceed your budget. With the spices you have collected, determine the maximum number of grams of mixed spices that can be made.<br><br>The minimum unit for purchasing spices is one gram, and the minimum unit for each spice that can be used when mixing spices is also one gram.",
  "input": "The first line contains two integers <em>N</em> and <em>C</em> — the number of spice types and your budget (<code>2 ≤ N ≤ 100</code>, <code>0 ≤ C ≤ 10<sup>10</sup></code>).<br><br>The next <em>N</em> lines each contain an integer <em>a<sub>i</sub></em> — the price per gram of the <em>i</em>-th spice (<code>1 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10000</code>).<br><br>The next <em>N</em> lines each contain an integer <em>b<sub>i</sub></em> — the quantity (in grams) of the <em>i</em>-th spice you already have (<code>0 ≤ b<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10000</code>).<br><br>The final <em>N</em> lines each contain an integer <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> — representing the mixing ratio of the <em>i</em>-th spice (<code>1 ≤ x<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10000</code>).<br><br>It is guaranteed that <code>gcd(x₁, x₂, …, x<sub>N</sub>) = 1</code>.",
