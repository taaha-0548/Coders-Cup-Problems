  "statement": "The Coders Cup begins on Monday! Now, the head of Competitive Programming, Mr. Taaha, wants to make a seating arrangement for all the teams. To keep the CP vibe alive even here, he decides that the arrangement should follow a very mathematical pattern.<br><br>There are <em>n</em> teams numbered from <em>1</em> to <em>n</em>, and seats are also numbered from <em>1</em> to <em>n</em>. Mr. Taaha wants to arrange the teams in such a way that the absolute difference between the team’s number and their seat number is exactly <em>k</em>.<br><br>Formally, for every position <em>i</em> (1-indexed), the team sitting at that position should have a number <em>p[i]</em> such that <code>|p[i] - i| = k</code>.<br><br>Among all possible valid seatings, Taaha wants the lexicographically smallest arrangement. If no valid arrangement exists, print <code>-1</code>.<br><br>Your task is to help him find this special seating plan so the Coders Cup can begin in perfect CP symmetry!",
"input": "The first line contains an integer <em>t</em> — the number of test cases (<code>1 ≤ t ≤ 10</code>). Each of the next <em>t</em> lines contains two space-separated integers <em>n</em> and <em>k</em> (<code>1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>5</sup></code>, <code>0 ≤ k ≤ n</code>).",
  "output": "If a seating plan does not exist, print -1, otherwise print <em>n</em> space-separated integers representing the lexicographically smallest valid arrangement.",
