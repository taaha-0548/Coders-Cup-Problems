  "statement": "There are <em>N</em> people sitting at a circular table for a long session of negotiations. Each person belongs to one of the three groups: A, B, or C. A group is happy if all of its members are sitting contiguously in a block of consecutive seats. You would like to make all groups happy by performing some sequence of swap operations. In each swap, two people exchange seats. Determine the minimum number of swaps required to make all groups happy.",
  "input": "The input consists of a single line containing <em>N</em> characters (<code>1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000</code>), where each character is 'A', 'B', or 'C'. The i-th character denotes the group of the person initially sitting at the i-th seat (seats are numbered clockwise).",
  "output": "Print a single integer — the minimum number of swaps required to make all groups happy.",
